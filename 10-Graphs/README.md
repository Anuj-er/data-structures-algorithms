# Graphs

This category includes problems involving graph data structures:
- Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
- Connected components
- Matrix-based graphs
- Grid problems

## Problems in this folder:
- 200. Number of Islands
- 547. Number of Provinces
- 733. Flood Fill
- 994. Rotting Oranges

## Key Patterns:
- Use BFS for shortest path problems
- Use DFS for exploring all paths
- Matrix can represent a graph
- Track visited nodes to avoid cycles
- Queue for BFS, Stack/Recursion for DFS
