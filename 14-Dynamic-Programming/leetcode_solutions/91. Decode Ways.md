# 🔐 91. Decode Ways | Recursive with Memoization

# Intuition
A numeric string represents an encoded message. You can decode it by taking either 1 digit or 2 digits (as long as they form a valid letter 1-26). Think of it as finding the number of paths to the end of a string where some paths are blocked by '0'.

# Approach
We use a top-down recursive strategy with a memoization table to cache path counts.

## 🎯 Top-Down Approach (Memoization)
**Why this approach?**  
Perfectly captures the branching nature of the problem: "Should I take one step or two?" By storing results in `dp[]`, we eliminate the exponential complexity of raw recursion.

**Special Logic:**
- **Zero Pruning**: If we hit a '0', that path is dead.
- **Two-Step Check**: Only combine two digits if they fall within the valid range `[10, 26]`.

```java []
class Solution {
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        int[] dp = new int[s.length()+1];
        return recur(s,0,dp);

    }
    public int recur(String s,int i,int[] dp){
        int n = s.length();

        if(i == n){
            dp[i] = 1;
            return 1;
        }
        if(s.charAt(i) == '0'){
            dp[i] = 0;
            return 0;
        }

        if(dp[i] != 0) return dp[i];

        int ways = 0;

        // 1 Step
        ways+=recur(s,i+1,dp);

        // 2 Step
        if(i+1<n){
            int num = (s.charAt(i) - '0') * 10 + (s.charAt(i+1) - '0');
            if(num >= 10 && num <= 26){
                ways+=recur(s,i+2,dp);
            }
        }
        dp[i] = ways;
        return dp[i];
    }
}
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | $O(N)$ — Each index is visited at most once. |
| **Space Complexity** | $O(N)$ — For the recursion stack and `dp` array. |

**🎯 Key Takeaways:**
- **Edge Case '0'**: Zeros are the "wall" in this problem. Any string starting with 0 or containing a 0 that can't be paired with a prefix is undecodable.
- **Memoization Benefit**: Without caching, this would be $O(2^n)$, making it effectively unsolvable for long strings.
- **Top-Down Clarity**: The logic `ways = oneStep + twoStep` is very readable in a recursive format.
