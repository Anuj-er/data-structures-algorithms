# Heap / Priority Queue

This category includes problems using heap data structure:
- Finding kth largest/smallest elements
- Priority-based processing
- Streaming data problems
- Top K problems

## Problems in this folder:
- 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
- 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
- 295. Find Median from Data Stream
- 347. Top K Frequent Elements
- 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
- 621. Task Scheduler
- 692. Top K Frequent Words
- 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

- 973. K Closest Points to Origin
- 1046. Last Stone Weight

## Key Patterns:
- Min heap for kth largest problems
- Max heap for kth smallest problems
- Two heaps for median problems
- Heap with custom comparator for complex ordering
- O(n log k) for top K problems
