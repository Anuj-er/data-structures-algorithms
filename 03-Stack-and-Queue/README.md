# Stack and Queue

This category includes problems that use stack or queue data structures:
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) for stacks
- FIFO (First In, First Out) for queues
- Monotonic stacks/queues
- Expression evaluation

## Problems in this folder:
- Valid Parentheses
- Min Stack implementation
- Stack/Queue implementations using each other
- Next Greater Element variants
- Daily Temperatures
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram
- Baseball Game scoring

## Key Patterns:
- Use stack for nested structures or "most recent" problems
- Monotonic stack for "next greater/smaller" problems
- Stack for expression parsing and validation
- Queue for level-order processing
