# Arrays and Hashing

This category includes problems that primarily involve:
- Array manipulation and traversal
- Hash maps/sets for frequency counting
- Finding duplicates or unique elements
- Array mathematical operations

## Problems in this folder:
- Two Sum variants
- Contains Duplicate
- Product of Array Except Self
- Valid Anagram
- Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Majority Element variants
- Array concatenation problems

## Key Patterns:
- Use hash maps for O(1) lookups
- Frequency counting with hash maps
- Two-pass algorithms for array problems
- In-place modifications when possible
