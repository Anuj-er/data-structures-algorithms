# Sliding Window

This category includes problems using the sliding window technique:
- Fixed-size windows
- Variable-size windows
- Maximum/minimum in subarrays
- Substring problems

## Problems in this folder:
- 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
- 239. Sliding Window Maximum
- 643. Maximum Average Subarray I
- 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

## Key Patterns:
- Two pointers to maintain window boundaries
- Expand window by moving right pointer
- Shrink window by moving left pointer
- Track window state (sum, max, min, etc.)
