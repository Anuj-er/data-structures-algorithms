# Two Pointers

This category includes problems that use the two-pointer technique:
- Left and right pointers moving toward each other
- Fast and slow pointers
- Problems involving sorted arrays
- Palindrome checking

## Problems in this folder:
- Container With Most Water
- Valid Palindrome variants
- Remove Duplicates/Elements
- Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)
- Merge operations
- Array rotation

## Key Patterns:
- Two pointers from opposite ends
- Two pointers moving in same direction at different speeds
- Problems often involve sorted arrays
- O(1) space complexity solutions
